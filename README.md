Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Hardest part was to get this on the first extension. Like oh boy I never speedrun a project as fast as this one. Seriously that was after coffee after coffee, and somehow no rest, and I have ADHD (i think, i get too distracted on literally anything). But hey, I pulled it off, even made a bonus, and even used a colorscheme, it just works. I wish I had more time tho. Like I wanted to make two game modes, the simple Wordle and the actual true Wordle. Lets hope I don't mess it up on next project, the adrenaline rush was cool but holy cow I don't wanna repeat that.
